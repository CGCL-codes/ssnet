# Friend Recommendations with Self-Rescaling Graph Neural Networks



This is an implementation for our KDD 2022 paper submission.

To run a model (e.g. PPRGo):

* Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

* Modify the data path `ALL_DATA_ROOT` in the script `Script/run_pprgo.sh`, check other configurations of the model, and run `bash Script/run_pprgo.sh`.
